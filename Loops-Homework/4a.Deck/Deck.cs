//Write a program that reads a card sign(as a string) from the console and generates and prints all possible cards from a standard deck of 52 cards up to the card with the given sign(without the jokers). The cards should be printed using the classical notation (like 5 of spades, A of hearts, 9 of clubs; and K of diamonds).
